Directives are a way to extend HTML by attaching custom behaviors to DOM elements or creating new HTML elements. They are a crucial part of Angular’s declarative approach to building user interfaces. With directives, you can manipulate the DOM, apply CSS styles, handle user input, and much more.

Angular provides four types of directives:

* **Component Directives:** These are the most common directives in Angular. Components are directives with templates. They encapsulate a part of the user interface and often have associated logic. They are used to create reusable UI components.

* **Attribute Directives:** Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. They are typically applied as attributes on HTML elements. Examples include `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, and `ngModel`.

* **Structural Directives:** Structural directives modify the DOM structure by adding or removing elements. The most well-known structural directives are `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngSwitch`.

* **Custom Directives:** Developers can create custom directives to extend Angular’s functionality. Custom directives can be attribute directives, structural directives, or both. They are useful for encapsulating complex behaviors and making the code more modular.

Some built-in directives are `ngClass`, `ngFor`, `ngStyle`, `ngModel`, `ngIf`, and `ngSwitch`.
