# Angular Vs AngularJs

Angular is a `TypeScript-based` open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build web, mobile and desktop applications. The major features of this framework include declarative templates, `dependency injection`, end to end tooling which ease application development.

Angular is a completely revived component-based framework in which an application is a tree of individual components.
