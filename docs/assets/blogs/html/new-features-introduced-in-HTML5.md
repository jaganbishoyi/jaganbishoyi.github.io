HTML5 introduced several new features to improve web development, including:

* **Semantic elements** like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to define the structure of a web page.
* **Multimedia support** with native audio (`<audio>`) and video (`<video>`) tags.
* **Canvas API** for drawing graphics using JavaScript.
* **Local storage** with `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for storing data on the client-side.
* **Geolocation API** for location-based services.

**Example:**

```html
<header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is a sample article using HTML5 semantic elements.</p>
    </article>
</section>
```
