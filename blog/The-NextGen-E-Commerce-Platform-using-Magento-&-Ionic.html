                                        <h3>How Can We Achieve it?</h3>
                                        <p>The beauty of Magento is its <a
                                                href="https://devdocs.magento.com/redoc/2.3/index.html"
                                                target="_blank">REST
                                                APIs</a>, which allow the developers to make
                                            amazing think out of it. Magento exposes different REST
                                            endpoints depending on
                                            the type of user making the requests. You must request and
                                            include a security
                                            token to gain access to the Customer and Admin REST API
                                            endpoints.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Next, we will move to Ionic. As we know Ionic is now
                                            officially integrated with
                                            Angular. It is much faster than previous versions. They
                                            really did some awesome
                                            engineering in routing as well as UI stand of view. Very
                                            soon it is going to
                                            integrate with Vue and React which will improve the overall
                                            performance of
                                            Native application.</p>
                                        <h3>Now come to how it will help to reduce the overall time &
                                            cost of development?
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>Integration(The bridge between backend and frontend) is a
                                            one-time process as
                                            long as you are not going to change the Magento version. Now
                                            only you have to
                                            take care of the UX & UI. We have to write the code in so
                                            efficient way that we
                                            can able to modify the at any point of time with minimal
                                            effort.</p>
                                        <p>When we are going to develop the application for 2nd & so on,
                                            we can reuse 70% of
                                            our initial code. All we have to do is, change the UI & UX
                                            as per the
                                            requirement in the current project.</p>
                                        <p>This is how we can reduce the overall time and cost of
                                            development.</p>
                                        <h3>How we can integrate Both?</h3>
                                        <p>Let me introduce the Hero, which help to reduce the 90%
                                            chance of the developer
                                            to banging the head to the wall, <a href="https://swagger.io"
                                                target="_blank">swagger</a>.
                                            Magento did a great job of maintaining
                                            such lovely documentation. You can found those here. In
                                            swagger, you can find
                                            all its endpoints including login, signup, view items, add
                                            to cart, checkout,
                                            gift card, downloadable products, etc.. The best part is we
                                            don’t need all of
                                            its API’s. Most of the time developers use 40 to 50 API to
                                            develop a Magento
                                            Ionic hybrid application. Here we don't need an admin panel,
                                            the web application
                                            is best to manage products. All we have to develop is a
                                            customer application.
